#Getting inputs as strings
grandmasNumbers= input("Enter the numbers on grandmother's card : ")
yourNumbers=input("Enter the numbers on your card : ")
drawnNumbers=input("Enter the numbers to be drawn from sack : ")

#Splitting inputs into arrays
grandmasNumbersArray=grandmasNumbers.split("-")
yourNumbersArray=yourNumbers.split("-")
drawnNumbersArray=drawnNumbers.split("-")

#Counter defining
grandmasCounter=0
yourCounter=0

#Comparing
###This section is trying to find if item in drawnNumberArray is also an item in grandmasNumbersArray or yourNumbersArray one by one in order.
###If an item is in any of these 2 arrays, it increase the counter of the array and remove that item from that array to get us able to write the remaining numbers in case of losing.
###And it also checks if any counters or both of them are 12, if they are then it prints the conclusion scenario which is established in question. 

for x in drawnNumbersArray:
  print("Selected number is ",x)
  if x in grandmasNumbersArray:
    grandmasNumbersArray.remove(x)
    grandmasCounter=grandmasCounter+1
  if x in yourNumbersArray:
    yourNumbersArray.remove(x)
    yourCounter=yourCounter+1
  if grandmasCounter==12 and yourCounter==12:
    print("There is a tie!")
    break
  if grandmasCounter==12:
    print("Grandmother won!")
    print("Your remaining numbers are as follows:")
    print(*yourNumbersArray, sep="\n")
    break
  if yourCounter==12:
    print("You won!")
    print("Grandmother's remaining numbers are as follows:")
    print(*grandmasNumbersArray, sep="\n")
    break
